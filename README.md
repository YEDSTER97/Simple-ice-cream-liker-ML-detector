# Simple-ice-cream-liker-ML-detector
It is just a simple model to predict if a person likes ice cream or not. A pet project for the foundation of a more complex model based on TensorFlow and PyTorch rather than scikit-learn is used here. Feel free to use this for your own learning and upgrade this code. For any doubts feel free to contact me.
