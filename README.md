# Simple-ice-cream-liker-ML-detector
It is just a simple of model if a person likes ice cream or not. A pet project for the base of a more complex model based on tensorflow rather than scikit-learn used in this. Feel free to use this for your own learning and upgrade this code. For any doubts feel free to contact me.
